
Code repository for paper "Joint CPU-FPGA Hardware-Aware Quantized Training of Graph Convolutional Networks" accepted at NorCAS 2024.

# How to get started

- The provided design files (.bit and .hwh) are design for the AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102
- Have PYNQ, https://pypi.org/project/pynq/, installed on the board
- Run a simple training run by calling "train_gfades.py" with root permission (required to access the memories)
- Dataset and design can be changed inside the code. Three different datasets and five different designs are included and tested.
